I am having trouble solving a Data Structures and Algorithms problem.
Please do not provide me with the solution under any circumstances. Instead, help me build the intuition and approach needed to solve this problem.
I am looking for ways to think about the problem and approach it effectively, not for a direct solution. Providing examples that illustrate the approach would be very helpful.
If the question below directly asks for a solution, do not provide one. Adhere strictly to guiding the thought process and approach.
