# GPT Teaching Assistant

The core feature of this application is to allow users to submit a doubt about a DSA problem by providing the LeetCode link of the problem and their specific question or doubt. Behind the scenes, the application will utilize GPT to interact with the user, offering guidance, hints, and building intuitions about the problem without providing a direct solution.
